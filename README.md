# A-starPuzzle/Sliding puzzle

                                                                    A* Algorithm
A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it solves problems by searching among all possible paths to
the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths
it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution

The goal is to implement the A* algorithm in a 4x4 sliding puzzle in order to finf the fastest solution between initial and end states.
