# A-starPuzzle/Sliding puzzle

A* algorithm

A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it solves problems by searching among all possible paths to
the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths
it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution

The A* algorithm is implemented in the sliding tiles puzzle in order to find the quickest solution between initial configuration and end states.
